Description: Provides a hypothesis test and variable selection algorithm for use in time-varying, concurrent regression models. The hypothesis test function is also accompanied by a plotting function which will show the estimated beta(s) and confidence band(s) from the hypothesis test. The hypothesis test function helps the user identify significant covariates within the scope of a time-varying concurrent model. The plots will show the amount of area that falls outside the confidence band(s) which is used for the test statistic within the hypothesis test.
